Samping from the DBPedia EN and DBPedia  FR 

## Universal-KG-sampling Method and Datasets
As the DBpedia dataset has many similarities to real-world KGs, experiments can better simulate the problems present in real-world KGs if we are conducted using the relatively large DBpedia dataset. We therefore chose a base dataset sampling algorithm to generate dataset based on the alignment of the embedded entities.
